          <div>
            <p>I am an associate professor at UNC Charlotte. I specializes in bioarchaeology and Andean archaeology. I have conducted research in Bolivia and Peru and plan to begin a project in Ecuador in Summer 2017. I have also worked locally, assisting with field projects in the Southeastern United States when possible. I am particularly interested in using human skeletal remains to investigates peopleâ€™s identities and social structures in the past. I have also worked with human remains to evaluate past medical practices (trepanation or skull surgery) and violence levels within past Andean populations.</p>
